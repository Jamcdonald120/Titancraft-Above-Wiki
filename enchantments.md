# Enchantments

The above has various special enchantments worked by "Grifter Magic".
Due to the unique nature of the Titan Shard loot, some of the enchants require explaining. This list is always in-progress and incomplete. If you know more, contact avivg2001 on Discord

In this google spreadsheet we try to keep track of which Enchantments are able to go on which tools/gear specifically and what they do. Feel free to add changes to the doc if you have new information.
